### What is Owner

Actors can have an Owner and if the outermost Owner is a PlayerController then that PlayerController owns the Actors.
For example a Flashlight Owned by a Pawn Owned by a PlayerController. If the Pawn is Unpossessed then neither the Flashlight nor the Pawn is Owned by any connection(PlayerController). A regular Actor can change ownership simply by using the function SetOwner on the server.   [参考](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/what-is-owner/446839)
